\begin{cvletter}

%\lettersection{Why Interos}
\lettersection{Why Me?}
I'm receptive to new ideas originating within me as well as others. I play well in teams and also like to work single-handedly when required. I have professional as well as research experience which makes me a candidate well suited for understanding the best of both worlds. I love challenges and take them positively to move to next level. 

Being a deep learning enthusiast who loves to build intelligent  agents aimed at solving variety of vision and language problems, I'd be naturally inclined to profiles like the one under consideration. My research lies at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing. I've developed image captioning system based on encoder-decoder neural network architecture which produces state-of-the-art results. Currently I’m researching efficient heuristic formulation approaches for drone motion planning based of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT). I'm confident that I'll be able to channelize my knowledge towards the business goals of the organization and would be able to further my knowledge while working for it.

  Please feel free to contact me to proceed towards further procedures. I look forward to hearing from you.
